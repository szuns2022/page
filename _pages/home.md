Aim
======
In order to study cutting-edge technologies and research hotspots of network science, Prof. Xiangrong Wang and Prof. Yamir Moreno are leading and organizing the 2025 International Workshop on Theoretical and Practical challenges in Network Science in Shenzhen University. Six foreign experts and several well-known domestic scholars, totaling about 100 people, were invited to participate in the conference, providing a platform for discussions about practical and theoretical aspects of modern network science.

Topic
======
The symposium covers a wide range of areas, including complex systems, networks, statistical physics, mathematical biology, etc., providing an academic exchange platform for fields such as the foundations of networks, social and economic networks, the integration of artificial intelligence into networks, and multi-layer and higher-order networks. 

The interdisciplinary nature of network science makes it one of the key scientific paradigms of the 21st century. The symposium at Shenzhen University is a microcosm of this highly relevant and topical area of research and will help promote the efficient transformation of theoretical breakthroughs into applications.

Place
======
Lecture Hall on the basement floor of Zhizhi Building, School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Shenzhen University
