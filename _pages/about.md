This symposium covers areas such as complex systems, networks, statistical physics, and mathematical biology, providing an academic exchange platform for fields like complex network theory, social and economic networks, integration of artificial intelligence, multi-layer networks and hypergraphs. Its interdisciplinary nature makes it one of the key scientific paradigms in the 21st century. This symposium by Shenzhen University is a reflection of this trend and promotes the efficient transformation of theoretical breakthroughs into applications.
